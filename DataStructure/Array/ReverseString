/*Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Language used : C#
*/

/*

First solution that I came up with. Logically, it is reversing the array. However, I am having a hard time displaying the result in the expected format. 
Additionally, time complexity is not O(1) 

solution: 
public class Solution {
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) {
        char [] t= new char[s.Length];
        int j=s.Length-1; 
        for(int i=0; i<s.Length; i++){
            t[i]=s[j];
            j--; 
        }
        /*foreach (var item in t) {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }*/
         Console.WriteLine(String.Join(",", t));
    }
}
*/

/*
Second solution . 
This was accepted. 
Language : C#
Time complexity:O(N) 
Space complexity: O(1)
*/

public class Solution {
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) {
        int left=0; 
        int right=s.Length-1; 
        while(left<right){
            char temp= s[left];
            s[left]=s[right];
            left++;
            s[right]=temp;
            right--;
        }
}
}
